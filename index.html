    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I&#39;m Rylan, a student. I think public transit is a really interesting topic to explore and I find it <strong>fascinating</strong> how all the different places around the world tackle this problem in different ways (with some accomplishing pretty marvelous things), and the unique challenges each and every instance of it has to face, especially working with existing infrastructure. I take the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home.html">Amtrak</a> regularly to get to school. It&#39;s a slower process than driving, but one I find really comfortable and has the potential to be better, especially seeing what other countries have done. I think the engineering, logistics, planning, and ingenuity that go into those transit systems are things I find fascinating, and the societal benefits from public transit should not be overlooked. This website serves as a showcase of this fascination of mine, and I hope to share that fascination with someone else. </p>
